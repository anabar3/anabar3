## Hi there! Ana speaking!

I am a Computer Science & Engineering student at Universidade da Coruña, in Galicia, Spain. Right now, though, I'm doing my Erasmus exchange at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology). <br />
I'm mostly interested in software engineering and web and interfaces design, but I still have a lot to learn ✨.  <br />

  <br />
I love creating, and I like to apply that in my projects or wherever I can, really. This is clearly reflected in my long list of hobbies: writing, drawing, crocheting, reading, journaling, watching movies/series, playing videogames, painting, miniature building... Just so you know me a bit better! Here I leave my profiles related to a couple of these: <br />
