## Hi there! Ana speaking!

I am a Computer Science & Engineering student at Universidade da Coruña, in Galicia, Spain. Right now, though, I'm doing my Erasmus exchange at NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology). <br />
I'm mostly interested in software engineering and web and interfaces design, but I still have a lot to learn ✨.  <br />
